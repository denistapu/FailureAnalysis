I am still fired up and ready to go. (APPLAUSE)Thank you. Thank you.Well, first of all, I want to congratulate Senator Clinton on a hard-fought victory here in New Hampshire. She did an outstanding job. Give her a big round of applause.(APPLAUSE)You know, a few weeks ago, no one imagined that we'd have accomplished what we did here tonight in New Hampshire. No one could have imagined it.For most of this campaign, we were far behind. We always knew our climb would be steep. But in record numbers, you came out, and you spoke up for change.And with your voices and your votes, you made it clear that at this moment, in this election, there is something happening in America.(APPLAUSE)There is something happening when men and women in Des Moines and Davenport, in Lebanon and Concord, come out in the snows of January to wait in lines that stretch block after block because they believe in what this country can be.There is something happening. There's something happening when Americans who are young in age and in spirit, who've never participated in politics before, turn out in numbers we have never seen because they know in their hearts that this time must be different.There's something happening when people vote not just for party that they belong to, but the hopes that they hold in common.And whether we are rich or poor, black or white, Latino or Asian, whether we hail from Iowa or New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, we are ready to take this country in a fundamentally new direction.That's what's happening in America right now; change is what's happening in America.You, all of you who are here tonight, all who put so much heart and soul and work into this campaign, you can be the new majority who can lead this nation out of a long political darkness.Democrats, independents and Republicans who are tired of the division and distraction that has clouded Washington, who know that we can disagree without being disagreeable, who understand that, if we mobilize our voices to challenge the money and influence that stood in our way and challenge ourselves to reach for something better, there is no problem we cannot solve, there is no destiny that we cannot fulfill.Our new American majority can end the outrage of unaffordable, unavailable health care in our time.We can bring doctors and patients, workers and businesses, Democrats and Republicans together, and we can tell the drug and insurance industry that, while they get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair, not this time, not now.(APPLAUSE)Our new majority can end the tax breaks for corporations that ship our jobs overseas and put a middle-class tax cut in the pockets of working Americans who deserve it.We can stop sending our children to schools with corridors of shame and start putting them on a pathway to success.We can stop talking about how great teachers are and start rewarding them for their greatness by giving them more pay and more support. We can do this with our new majority.We can harness the ingenuity of farmers and scientists, citizens and entrepreneurs to free this nation from the tyranny of oil and save our planet from a point of no return.And when I am president of the United States, we will end this war in Iraq and bring our troops home.(APPLAUSE)We will end this war in Iraq. We will bring our troops home. We will finish the job -- we will finish the job against Al Qaida in Afghanistan. We will care for our veterans. We will restore our moral standing in the world.And we will never use 9/11 as a way to scare up votes, because it is not a tactic to win an election. It is a challenge that should unite America and the world against the common threats of the 21st century: terrorism and nuclear weapons, climate change and poverty, genocide and disease.All of the candidates in this race share these goals. All of the candidates in this race have good ideas and all are patriots who serve this country honorably.(APPLAUSE)But the reason our campaign has always been different, the reason we began this improbable journey almost a year ago is because it's not just about what I will do as president. It is also about what you, the people who love this country, the citizens of the United States of America, can do to change it.That's what this election is all about.That's why tonight belongs to you. It belongs to the organizers, and the volunteers, and the staff who believed in this journey and rallied so many others to join the cause.We know the battle ahead will be long. But always remember that, no matter what obstacles stand in our way, nothing can stand in the way of the power of millions of voices calling for change.We have been told we cannot do this by a chorus of cynics. And they will only grow louder and more dissonant in the weeks and months to come.We've been asked to pause for a reality check. We've been warned against offering the people of this nation false hope. But in the unlikely story that is America, there has never been anything false about hope.(APPLAUSE)For when we have faced down impossible odds, when we've been told we're not ready or that we shouldn't try or that we can't, generations of Americans have responded with a simple creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can. Yes, we can. Yes, we can.It was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation: Yes, we can.It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights: Yes, we can.It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness: Yes, we can.It was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for the ballot, a president who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a king who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised land: Yes, we can, to justice and equality.Yes, we can, to opportunity and prosperity. Yes, we can heal this nation. Yes, we can repair this world. Yes, we can.And so, tomorrow, as we take the campaign south and west, as we learn that the struggles of the textile workers in Spartanburg are not so different than the plight of the dishwasher in Las Vegas, that the hopes of the little girl who goes to the crumbling school in Dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of L.A., we will remember that there is something happening in America, that we are not as divided as our politics suggest, that we are one people, we are one nation.And, together, we will begin the next great chapter in the American story, with three words that will ring from coast to coast, from sea to shining sea: Yes, we can.Thank you, New Hampshire. Thank you. Thank you.",http://www.songlyrics.com/barack-obama/yes-we-can-01-08-2008-lyrics/,1,124.3

The first public step in the notice and comment rulemaking process is for us to issue a proposed rule (also called a ânotice of proposed rulemakingâ or âNPRMâ).  The proposed rule explains what we intend to require or intend to do, as well as our basis (e.g., scientific and policy reasons) and asks for public comment.  Comments are generally submitted via the Federal Governmentâs electronic docket site, available at Regulations.gov. If we need more information or have not decided on the details of a regulatory path, sometimes we issue a request for comments or an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM).  These kinds of Federal Register notices ask for public comment on broad issues or questions and seek data or other information.  We use the information provided by the public comments to help us formulate the specific policy to be put forth in a subsequent proposed rule.Once we have issued a proposed rule and received and reviewed the public comments, we decide whether further action is needed.  Based on the comments, we might decide to end the rulemaking process, to issue a new proposed rule, or to issue a final rule.  If we decide to issue a final rule, we publish the final rule in the Federal Register. The final rule explains the regulatory requirements (also known as the ""codified"" portion), the impact of these requirements on industry or the public, and responds to the comments on the proposed rule.  These regulatory requirements, or codified portion of the final rule, also are published under Title 21 of Code of Federal Regulations.CFR Resources:21 CFR Database on FDA.govSearchable database; updated once a yearGPO Electronic Code of Federal Regulations (eCFR)External Link DisclaimerCurrently updated online version  Review of Proposed and Final RulesOnce we complete a proposed or final rule, but before it is published in the Federal Register, it may be reviewed by other parts of the federal government.  For example, we are part of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), so the Office of the Secretary of HHS or other HHS sister agencies may review a draft rule before it is published.  In addition, we may consult with non-HHS agencies when working on a rulemaking that has a broader impact.If proposed or final rules are deemed ""significant"" pursuant to Executive Order 12866, the Office of Management and Budgetâs (OMB) Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) must review them and coordinate review with other Federal agencies that have an interest in the issues.  In these cases, we work with OIRA to obtain appropriate clearances.  More information about EO 12866 and OIRAâs role in the review of significant regulations can be found on the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs Q&A's page.",https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/fda-rules-and-regulations,1,103

And, not just that, but heâs known to have berated members of his staff for wearing masks in his office. Well, news broke today that Gohmert has COVID-19. And word has it that the Congressman, after finding out that he had the disease, returned to his D.C. office to inform his staff in person, putting them all at risk. And that itself would probably warrant a conversation here. But Gohmert, as heâs known to do, went one step further, telling a Texas reporter today that he likely contracted the disease not because of his time spent flaunting public health guideline, but because of the fact that he has, on occasion, worn a mask. Thatâs right, the Congressman is suggesting that mask wearing is likely responsible for his condition. Oh, and to cap it all off, heâs now saying that heâs going to take Trumpâs advice and start taking hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug that the FDA says is âunlikely to be effective in treating COVID-19,â to treat the disease.",http://markmaynard.com/2020/07/today-in-stupid-america-republican-congressman-louie-gohmert-gets-diagnosed-with-covid-19-says-he-probably-got-it-because-he-was-wearing-a-mask/,1,131.64

He took charge of his family's real-estate business in 1971, renamed it The Trump Organization, and expanded its operations from Queens and Brooklyn into Manhattan. The company built or renovated skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. Trump later started various side ventures, mostly by licensing his name. He bought the Miss Universe brand of beauty pageants in 1996, and sold it in 2015. Trump and his businesses had been involved in more than 4,000 state and federal legal actions, including six bankruptcies. He produced and hosted The Apprentice, a reality television series, from 2003 to 2015. As of 2020, Forbes estimated his net worth to be $2.1 billion.[a]Trump's political positions have been described as populist, protectionist, and nationalist. He entered the 2016 presidential race as a Republican and was elected in a surprise victory over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although he lost the popular vote.[b] He became the oldest first-term U.S. president,[c] and the first without prior military or government service. His election and policies have sparked numerous protests. Trump has made many false or misleading statements during his campaign and presidency. The statements have been documented by fact-checkers, and the media have widely described the phenomenon as unprecedented in American politics. Many of his comments and actions have been characterized as racially charged or racist.During his presidency, Trump ordered a travel ban on citizens from several Muslim-majority countries, citing security concerns; after legal challenges, the Supreme Court upheld the policy's third revision. He enacted a tax-cut package for individuals and businesses, rescinding the individual health insurance mandate penalty. He appointed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Trump has pursued an America First agenda, withdrawing the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations, the Paris Agreement on climate change, and the Iran nuclear deal. He imposed import tariffs which triggered a trade war with China, recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and withdrew U.S. troops from northern Syria. Trump met thrice with North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, but talks on denuclearization broke down in 2019.A special counsel investigation led by Robert Mueller found that Trump and his campaign welcomed and encouraged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election under the belief that it would be politically advantageous, but did not find sufficient evidence to press charges of criminal conspiracy or coordination with Russia.[d] Mueller also investigated Trump for obstruction of justice, and his report neither indicted nor exonerated Trump on that offense. After Trump solicited the investigation by Ukraine of a political rival, Joe Biden, who later became his presumptive Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election, the House of Representatives impeached him in December 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The Senate acquitted him of both charges in February 2020",https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump,1,95.35

(Anything over 90 percent typically means the company is losing money on each claim.) It also says itâs on track for $1 billion in gross premium revenue by yearâs end.The company says it plans to grow at a measured rate of four to five cities per year, and is expecting to reach 260,000 members in 2018, up from a peak of 100,000 in 2017.âHockey stick business models donât work in health care,â said Brian Singerman, an investor at Founders Fund, who led the round.âMario and Josh knew that Oscar had to earn the trust of patients and rebuild each piece of the insurance stack with technology, completely from scratch,â he said.Proving its valuationHealth insurance experts say Oscar still has a long road ahead to prove its valuation.âWhile start-up insurers have the potential to show massive revenue growth, underlying profitability for companies that actually have viable businesses is limited through market forces and regulatory requirements,â said Ari Gottlieb, a consultant who specializes in health insurance.â³(Oscarâs) valuation per member is six to eight times that of established, publicly traded health plans that have actually achieved consistent profitability.âOscarâs Schlosser says the companyâs valuation is warranted, given that it has built âeverything in house,â including technology for processing claims and managing its members, which it describes as unique.Down the road, he described Oscar as having big plans to move into other markets, like Medicare, and he didnât rule out a partnership with the companyâs newest investor: Verily. Alphabet, as CNBC recently reported, is considering its own move into a lucrative corner of the health insurance market.Other investors that participated in the round include Joe Lonsdaleâs 8VC, Fidelity, General Catalyst, Khosla Ventures and Thrive Capital, among others.",https://www.cnbc.com/2018/03/27/oscar-health-raises-165-million-at-3-point-2-billion-alphabet-founders.html,1,51.44

The disease that infection with the virus causes is called COVID-19.In the new study, the CCDC team extracted all the COVID-19 cases that Chinaâs Infectious Disease Information System had recorded.In their analysis, the scientists included the following:a âsummary of patient characteristicsâan analysis of viral spread by age and sexa calculation of deaths and the âcase fatality rateâan analysis of viral spread over time and geographical spacean epidemiological curve, or visual display of the outbreaka subgroup analysis of cases outside of Chinaâs Hubei Province and âall cases among health workers nationwideâThe findings appear in the journal CCDC Weekly.80.9% of the cases are âmildâThe researchers analyzed a total of 72,314 patient records, which included: â44,672 (61.8%) confirmed cases, 16,186 (22.4%) suspected cases, 10,567 (14.6%) clinically diagnosed cases,â and â889 asymptomatic cases (1.2%).âOf the total number of individuals with confirmed cases, 80.9% were said to be âmild.â Most of the adults affected were between 30 and 79 years old.Of the total number of confirmed cases, there were 1,023 fatalities, the equivalent of a death rate of 2.3%.

Specifically, up to the age of 39 years old, the fatality rate is 0.2%, at the age of 40, it is 0.4%, 1.3% for those in their 50s, 3.6% for people in their 60s, and finally, 8% for those in their 70s.By comparison, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that health experts have likened coronavirus to affected fewer people in 2002â2003, but the death rate was 14â15%, according to the World Health Organization (WHO).In terms of the geotemporal spread of the virus, the study confirms that âCOVID-19 spread outward from Hubei Province sometime after December 2019, and by February 11, 2020, 1,386 counties across all 31 provinces were affected.âThe study also found that people with cardiovascular disease were at the highest risk of death from coronavirus, followed by those with diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, hypertension, and cancer.Furthermore, the authors note a âdownward trend in the overall epidemic curve.âThe epidemic curve showed that the onset of symptoms âpeaked around January 23â26, then began to decline, leading up to February 11,â they write.They add that this suggests âthat perhaps isolation of whole cities, broadcast of critical information (e.g., promoting handwashing, mask wearing, and care seeking) with high frequency through multiple channels, and mobilization of [a] multi-sector rapid response teams is helping to curb the epidemic.âHowever, the authors caution that a âreboundâ of the epidemic is still very much possible:â[The] COVID-19 epidemic has spread very quickly, taking only 30 days to expand from Hubei to the rest of Mainland China. With many people returning from a long holiday, China needs to prepare for the possible rebound of the epidemic.âThe study also found that âA total of 1,716 health workers have become infected and 5 have died (0.3%).âHowever, âThe percentage of severe cases among Wuhan medical staff has gradually decreased from 38.9% at the peak (on January 28) to 12.7% in early February.âADVERTISEMENTUncategorizedPublic HealthRespiratoryInfectious Diseases / Bacteria / VirusesCOVID-19Written by Ana Sandoiu on February 19, 2020 â Fact checked by Carolyn Robertson",https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/coronavirus-81-of-cases-are-mild-study-says,1,43.79
