No, that's not true: A meme making the rounds on Facebook claims the acronym of the highly infectious and worldwide virus, COVID-19, or coronavirus, was named for China - where it appears to have originated.The claim surfaced in a post (archived here) published on Facebook on March 22, 2020. The meme in the post read:Hate to break this to all of the morons who call themselves JournalistsCOVID literally stands for ""Chinese Originated Viral Infectious Disease"" and the number 19 is due to this being the 19th virus to come out of China.""It's hard to know if this meme originated as a joke or was created as a way to spread xenophobia and fake news. But nothing about it is true. In fact, the World Health Organization announced the official name of the disease on February 11, 2020, with the CDC explaining the abbreviation ""COVID-19"" means this:'CO' stands for 'corona,' 'VI' for 'virus,' and 'D' for disease.Formerly, this disease was referred to as ""2019 novel coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV"".Why do the disease and virus have different names? As explained by the experts at WHO, people often know the name of the disease - such as AIDS or measles - but are not as familiar with the name of the virus that causes it, like HIV and rubeola.The coronavirus was first identified in Wuhan, China, and President Trump often refers to it as the ""Chinese virus,"" leading to charges he is inflaming racial tensions. There have also been allegations that the president's slang for the novel coronavirus has led to assaults on people of Asian descent.But in WHO's announcement naming the virus, it noted worldwide experts intentionally agreed not to refer to a geographical location to avoid stigmatizing a region. It says in looking for a pronounceable name that referred to the virus, it also wanted to avoid naming the disease after animals or a specific group of people.",https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2020/03/Fact-Check-COVID-Does-NOT-Stand-For-Chinese-Originated-Viral-Infectious-Disease'.html,1,293.25

Everything about it is renewing for me, almost like therapyâ¦ Beach Therapy. -Amy DykensA pool just isnât the same as the ocean. It has no energy. No life. âLinda GerberI spent uncounted hours sitting at the bow looking at the water and the sky, studying each wave, different from the last, seeing how it caught the light, the air, the wind; watching patterns, the sweep of it all, and letting it take me. The sea. âGary PaulsenThe three great elemental sounds in nature are the sound of rain, the sound of wind in a primeval wood, and the sound of outer ocean on a beach. -Henry BestonI could never stay long enough on the shore; the tang of the untainted, fresh, and free sea air was like a cool, quieting thought. -Helen KellerâDoesnât it seem to you,â asked Madame Bovary, âthat the mind moves more freely in the presence of that boundless expanse, that the sight of it elevates the soul and gives rise to thoughts of the infinite and the ideal?â âGustave Flaubert, Madame BovaryThe ocean is a place of skin, rich outer membranes hiding thick juicy insides, laden with the soup of being. âVera NazarianWhat would an ocean be without a monster lurking in the dark? It would be like sleep without dreams. -Werner HerzogWhen anxious, uneasy and bad thoughts come, I go to the sea, and the sea drowns them out with its great wide sounds, cleanses me with its noise, and imposes a rhythm upon everything in me that is bewildered and confused. -Rainer Maria RilkeFor whatever we lose (like a you or a me) itâs always ourselves we find in the sea. -e.e. cummingsAnd it is an interesting biological fact that all of us have, in our veins the exact same percentage of salt in our blood that exists in the ocean, and, therefore, we have salt in our blood, in our sweat, in our tears. We are tied to the ocean. And when we go back to the sea, whether it is to sail or to watch it, we are going back from whence we came.  âJohn F. KennedyThe ocean makes me feel really small and it makes me put my whole life into perspectiveâ¦ it humbles you and makes you feel almost like youâve been baptized. I feel born again when I get out of the ocean. -BeyoncÃ© KnowlesBut more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of ocean. -H. P. LovecraftThere was a magic about the sea. People were drawn to it. People wanted to love by it, swim in it, play in it, look at it. It was a living thing that was as unpredictable as a great stage actor: it could be calm and welcoming, opening its arms to embrace itâs audience one moment, but then could explode with its stormy tempers, flinging people around, wanting them out, attacking coastlines, breaking down islands. âCecelia AhernThe sea does not reward those who are too anxious, too greedy, or too impatient. One should lie empty, open, choiceless as a beach â waiting for a gift from the sea. -Anne Morrow LindberghWhy do we love the sea? It is because it has some potent power to make us think things we like to think. -Robert HenriAt the beach, life is different. Time doesnât move hour to hour but mood to moment. We live by the currents, plan by the tides, and follow the sun. -AnonymousMy soul is full of longing / For the secret of the sea, / And the heart of the great ocean / Sends a thrilling pulse through me. -Henry Wadsworth LongfellowThe use of sea and air is common to all; neither can a title to the ocean belong to any people or private persons, forasmuch as neither nature nor public use and custom permit any possession therof. -Elizabeth I, Queen of EnglandThe voice of the sea speaks to the soul. The touch of the sea is sensuous, enfolding the body in its soft, close embrace. -Kate ChopinI felt the full breadth and depth of the ocean around the sphere of the Earth, back billions of years to the beginning of life, across all the passing lives and deaths, the endless waves of swimming joy and quiet losses of exquisite creatures with fins and fronds, tentacles and wings, colourful and transparent, tiny and huge, coming and going. There is nothing the ocean has not seen. âSally AndrewThe waves of the sea help me get back to me. -Jill DavisThereâs nothing wrong with enjoying looking at the surface of the ocean itself, except that when you finally see what goes on underwater, you realize that youâve been missing the whole point of the ocean. Staying on the surface all the time is like going to the circus and staring at the outside of the tent. -Dave BarryI couldnât imagine living in a state that didnât reach the ocean. It was a giant reset button. You could go to the edge of the land and see infinity and feel renewed. âAvery SawyerALSO CHECK OUT:30 Best Quotes About Nature40 Best Quotes About Solitude30 Best Quotes About Being PresentWant to see more quotes?

Yes, we can.It was a creed written into the founding documents that declared the destiny of a nation: Yes, we can.It was whispered by slaves and abolitionists as they blazed a trail towards freedom through the darkest of nights: Yes, we can.It was sung by immigrants as they struck out from distant shores and pioneers who pushed westward against an unforgiving wilderness: Yes, we can.It was the call of workers who organized, women who reached for the ballot, a president who chose the moon as our new frontier, and a king who took us to the mountaintop and pointed the way to the promised land: Yes, we can, to justice and equality.Yes, we can, to opportunity and prosperity. Yes, we can heal this nation. Yes, we can repair this world. Yes, we can.And so, tomorrow, as we take the campaign south and west, as we learn that the struggles of the textile workers in Spartanburg are not so different than the plight of the dishwasher in Las Vegas, that the hopes of the little girl who goes to the crumbling school in Dillon are the same as the dreams of the boy who learns on the streets of L.A., we will remember that there is something happening in America, that we are not as divided as our politics suggest, that we are one people, we are one nation.And, together, we will begin the next great chapter in the American story, with three words that will ring from coast to coast, from sea to shining sea: Yes, we can.Thank you, New Hampshire.

Experts advised against using concentrated UV light to prevent or treat the coronavirus and do not recommend going in the sunlight to kill the virus.Only levels of UV light much higher than what is in sunlight can kill viruses, experts said, and the levels that kill viruses can cause irritation to human skin and should be avoided.Pokrath Hansasuta, assistant professor of virology at Chulalongkorn University, explained what happens to AFP Fact Check.âUltraviolet is able to kill COVID-19 if it is exposed to the concentrated UV ray in a certain amount of time and distance,â she said. âHowever, that level of UV exposure is harmful to humanâs skin. Most likely, it will be in the light bulb or lamp as the natural UV from the sun is not strong enough to kill it.The World Health Organization created a graphic as part of a series of myth busters about the coronavirus that tells the public not to use UV light to kill the virus. âUV lamps should not be used to sterilize hands or other areas of skin as UV radiation can cause skin irritation,â the graphic reads.Neither sunlight nor UV light is listed as a preventive measure on the websites of the WHO or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.There is some evidence to suggest the spread of the virus may slow down as the weather gets warmer. That may lead some to incorrectly suggest sunlight as a tip to stay healthy. Time magazine reported on new research that has not yet been peer-reviewed that suggested the possibility of a connection between heat and the rate of the spread of the coronavirus, but experts concluded the research is still early and not definitive.Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in an NPR interview in February that it's unclear how the coronavirus will react to heat or sunlight.""I think it's premature to assume that,"" Messonnier said. ""We haven't been through even a single year with this pathogen.""Our ruling: FalseFriedman referred to sunlight as âvirus destroying sunlight.â This is FALSE. There is no evidence proving sunlight kills the coronavirus. Only highly concentrated UV rays are reported to kill viruses, and the World Health Organization advises against using UV rays because they can damage skin.Our fact-check sourcesNPRCDC How to Protect YourselfAbout CDC 24-7World Health OrganizationAFP Fact CheckAbout U.S. Congressman Gregory F.

Many of those people, Lipsitch clarifies, won't have severe illnesses or even show symptoms at all, which is already the case for many people who have tested positive for the virus.That's precisely why he doesn't think the virus can be stopped. Viruses like SARS, MERS, and the avian flu were eventually contained in part because they were more intense and had a higher fatality rate. In other words, if you were infected by the virus that caused SARS, chances were you weren't out and about. But because the current coronavirus, known as COVID-19, can be asymptomatic, or at least very mild, there's a better chance people will likely go about their day as normal. The down side, though, is that it becomes harder to trace and prevent. In that sense it's similar to the flu, which can also be deadly, but often passes without the infected person seeking medical care.",https://www.sbs.com.au/news/harvard-scientists-say-coronavirus-lockdowns-could-be-here-to-stay-until-2022,3,811.42

But don't be too alarmed. Many of those people, Lipsitch clarifies, won't have severe illnesses or even show symptoms at all, which is already the case for many people who have tested positive for the virus.That's precisely why he doesn't think the virus can be stopped. Viruses like SARS, MERS, and the avian flu were eventually contained in part because they were more intense and had a higher fatality rate. In other words, if you were infected by the virus that caused SARS, chances were you weren't out and about. But because the current coronavirus, known as COVID-19, can be asymptomatic, or at least very mild, there's a better chance people will likely go about their day as normal. The down side, though, is that it becomes harder to trace and prevent. In that sense it's similar to the flu, which can also be deadly, but often passes without the infected person seeking medical care.",https://www.sbs.com.au/news/harvard-scientists-say-coronavirus-lockdowns-could-be-here-to-stay-until-2022,3,811.42
